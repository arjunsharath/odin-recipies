    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that
         includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that
          are steamed together. The bottom layer of rice
           absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it
            a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top layer 
            of rice turns out white and fluffy. Buried in the 
            Biryani, youll find whole cuts of succulent chicken
             bursting with flavor from the potent array of
              spices, herbs, and aromatics its marinated in.</p>
